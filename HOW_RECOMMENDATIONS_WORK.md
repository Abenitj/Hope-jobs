# 🎯 How Job Recommendations Work

**Simple Guide to Understanding the Recommendation System**

---

## 📌 What Does It Do?

When a job seeker logs into Hope Jobs, the system automatically:
1. Looks at their profile (skills, preferences, location, experience)
2. Compares it with all available jobs
3. Scores each job from 0-100 based on how well it matches
4. Shows the **best matches first** with explanations

**Result:** Each user sees **different jobs** based on what they're looking for! ✨

---

## 🎲 How Does the Scoring Work?

Every job gets a score out of **100 points**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  40 points → Skills Match          │  (Most Important)
│  30 points → Job Type Match        │
│  15 points → Location Match        │
│  10 points → Experience Level      │
│   5 points → Recently Posted       │
│                                     │
│  Total: 100 points possible        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**High score = Better match!**

---

## 🛠️ 1. Skills Match (40 points)

This is the **most important** factor.

### Example:

**User's Skills:**
```
✓ JavaScript
✓ React
✓ CSS
```

**Job Requires:**
```
✓ JavaScript
✓ React
✓ Node.js
```

**Calculation:**
- User has 2 out of 3 required skills (JavaScript ✓, React ✓, Node.js ✗)
- Match: 2/3 = 67%
- Score: 67% of 40 = **26.7 points**

---

## 🔍 What is Fuzzy Matching?

**Problem:** People make typos or write skills differently!

```
User writes: "javascprit"  (typo!)
Job needs:   "javascript"

WITHOUT fuzzy matching: ❌ NO MATCH
WITH fuzzy matching:    ✅ MATCH!
```

### How Fuzzy Matching Works:

The system checks **4 different ways** to match skills:

#### **Level 1: Exact Match**
```
User: "JavaScript"
Job:  "JavaScript"
Result: ✅ Perfect match!
```

#### **Level 2: Contains/Substring**
```
User: "React"
Job:  "React Developer"
Result: ✅ Match! (Job contains "React")
```

#### **Level 3: Aliases (Variations)**
```
User: "JS"
Job:  "JavaScript"
Result: ✅ Match! (System knows JS = JavaScript)

User: "ReactJS"
Job:  "React"
Result: ✅ Match! (System knows ReactJS = React)

User: "Node.js"
Job:  "NodeJS"
Result: ✅ Match! (Different formats)
```

**Common Aliases the System Knows:**
- JavaScript = JS = java script
- TypeScript = TS = type script
- React = ReactJS = React.js
- Node.js = NodeJS = Node
- Python = Python3 = Py
- PostgreSQL = Postgres = pg
- MongoDB = Mongo
- Kubernetes = k8s

#### **Level 4: Typo Tolerance**

This uses **Levenshtein Distance** - a fancy name for counting how many letter changes are needed.

**Example 1:**
```
User: "javascprit"  (typo: letters swapped)
Job:  "javascript"

Changes needed: 2 (fix 'cp' → 'sc')
Similarity: 90% (very close!)
Result: ✅ MATCH! (80% threshold)
```

**Example 2:**
```
User: "Reactt"  (extra 't')
Job:  "React"

Changes needed: 1 (remove extra 't')
Similarity: 83%
Result: ✅ MATCH!
```

**Example 3:**
```
User: "Java"
Job:  "Python"

Changes needed: 5 (completely different)
Similarity: 17%
Result: ❌ NO MATCH (too different)
```

**Rule:** If words are **80% similar or more**, they match!

---

## 💼 2. Job Type Match (30 points)

Checks if the job type matches what the user wants.

**User Preferences:**
```
✓ FULL_TIME
✓ REMOTE
```

**Job Type:** `FULL_TIME`

**Result:** ✅ Perfect match! → **30 points**

---

**Job Type:** `PART_TIME`

**Result:** ❌ No match → **0 points**

---

**User has no preferences set:**

**Result:** Neutral → **15 points** (don't penalize)

---

## 📍 3. Location Match (15 points)

Checks if the job location matches user's preferred location.

**Example 1:**
```
User Location: "Addis Ababa"
Job Location:  "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"

Result: ✅ MATCH! → 15 points
```

**Example 2:**
```
User Location: "Bole"
Job Location:  "Bole, Addis Ababa"

Result: ✅ MATCH! → 15 points
```

**Example 3:**
```
User Location: "Addis Ababa"
Job Location:  "Bahir Dar"

Result: ❌ NO MATCH → 0 points
```

---

## 📊 4. Experience Level (10 points)

Matches user's years of experience with what the job needs.

### How It Works:

**System extracts years from user's experience:**
```
"3 years as Frontend Developer" → 3 years
"Senior Developer (5+ years)" → 5 years
```

**Then matches with job level:**

| Job Says | User Has | Match? | Points |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| "Entry level" or "Junior" | 0-2 years | ✅ Perfect | 10 |
| "Entry level" or "Junior" | 5+ years | ⚠️ Overqualified | 7 |
| "Mid-level" or "2-4 years" | 2-5 years | ✅ Perfect | 10 |
| "Senior" or "Lead" | 5+ years | ✅ Perfect | 10 |
| "Senior" or "Lead" | 2 years | ⚠️ Underqualified | 5 |

---

## ⏰ 5. Recency Bonus (5 points)

Rewards recently posted jobs (they're more likely to be hiring).

| Posted | Points |
|--------|--------|
| This week (0-7 days) | +5 |
| This month (8-30 days) | +2.5 |
| Older (30+ days) | 0 |
