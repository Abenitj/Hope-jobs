# 🎯 Job Recommendation System Documentation

## Overview

The Hope Jobs recommendation system intelligently matches job seekers with relevant job postings based on their profile information. The system uses a **multi-factor scoring algorithm** with **fuzzy matching** to handle typos and skill variations.

## What Gets Matched?

```
┌─────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
│   User Profile      │  ⟷     │   Job Posting       │
│                     │         │                     │
│ • Skills            │ ⟷      │ • Required Skills   │
│ • Preferred Types   │ ⟷      │ • Job Type          │
│ • Location          │ ⟷      │ • Location          │
│ • Experience        │ ⟷      │ • Requirements      │
└─────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘
```

**Note:** The system matches **User Profile ⟷ Job Postings** (NOT Company Profiles) because:
- Each job has specific requirements
- One company can post many different jobs
- Job seekers care about the specific role, not just the company

---

## Scoring Algorithm

Each job is scored from **0-100** based on how well it matches the user's profile:

### Factor Weights

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 🛠️ **Skills Match** | 40% | Most important factor |
| 💼 **Job Type** | 30% | Full-time, Part-time, etc. |
| 📍 **Location** | 15% | Geographic proximity |
| 📊 **Experience** | 10% | Seniority level match |
| ⏰ **Recency** | 5% | Recently posted jobs |

---

## 1. Skills Matching (40 points)

### How It Works

The system compares user skills with job requirements using **4 levels of matching**:

#### Level 1: Exact Match ✅
```
User: "JavaScript"
Job:  "JavaScript"
Result: ✅ MATCH
```

#### Level 2: Substring Match ✅
```
User: "React"
Job:  "React Developer"
Result: ✅ MATCH
```

#### Level 3: Alias/Variation Match ✅
```
User: "JS"
Job:  "JavaScript"
Result: ✅ MATCH (via alias mapping)

User: "ReactJS"
Job:  "React"
Result: ✅ MATCH (via alias mapping)
```

#### Level 4: Fuzzy Match (Typo Tolerance) ✅
```
User: "javascprit"  (typo)
Job:  "javascript"
Similarity: 90%
Result: ✅ MATCH (80%+ similarity threshold)

User: "Reactt"  (typo)
Job:  "React"
Similarity: 83%
Result: ✅ MATCH
```

### Supported Skill Aliases

The system recognizes common variations:

| Canonical | Variations |
|-----------|------------|
| JavaScript | js, javascript, java script, javascprit |
| TypeScript | ts, typescript, type script |
| React | react, reactjs, react.js, react js |
| Node.js | node, nodejs, node.js, node js |
| Python | python, python3, py |
| C++ | cpp, c++, cplusplus |
| C# | csharp, c#, c sharp |
| MongoDB | mongo, mongodb, mongo db |
| PostgreSQL | postgres, postgresql, pg |
| Docker | docker, containerization |
| Kubernetes | k8s, kubernetes, kube |
| AWS | aws, amazon web services |

### Calculation Example

**User Skills:** `["JavaScript", "React", "CSS"]`  
**Job Skills:** `["JavaScript", "Reactt", "Node.js"]` (notice typo in "Reactt")

**Matching:**
- "JavaScript" ✅ Exact match
- "Reactt" ✅ Fuzzy match with "React" (83% similar)
- "Node.js" ❌ User doesn't have this

**Score:** 2 out of 3 skills = 66.7% → **26.7 points** (66.7% of 40)

---

## 2. Job Type Preference (30 points)

Matches user's preferred job types with the job posting type.

**User Preferences:** `["FULL_TIME", "REMOTE"]`

| Job Type | Match | Score |
|----------|-------|-------|
| FULL_TIME | ✅ Yes | 30 points |
| PART_TIME | ❌ No | 0 points |
| CONTRACT | ❌ No | 0 points |

**Fallback:** If user hasn't specified preferences → 15 points (neutral)

---

## 3. Location Match (15 points)

Uses flexible substring matching to handle location variations.

### Examples

```
User: "Addis Ababa"
Job:  "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"
Result: ✅ MATCH (15 points)

User: "Addis Ababa"
Job:  "Bahir Dar"
Result: ❌ NO MATCH (0 points)

User: "Bole"
Job:  "Bole, Addis Ababa"
Result: ✅ MATCH (15 points)
```

**Fallback:** If no location specified → 7.5 points (neutral)

---

## 4. Experience Level (10 points)

Matches user's years of experience with job requirements.

### Experience Extraction

The system extracts years from experience entries:
```
"3 years as Frontend Developer" → 3 years
"Senior Developer (5+ years)" → 5 years
```

### Matching Logic

| Job Level | User Experience | Score |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Entry/Junior | 0-2 years | 10 points |
| Entry/Junior | 3+ years | 7 points (overqualified) |
| Mid-level | 2-5 years | 10 points |
| Senior/Lead | 5+ years | 10 points |
| Senior/Lead | 2-4 years | 5 points (underqualified) |

**Fallback:** If can't determine level → 5 points (neutral)

---

## 5. Recency Bonus (5 points)

Rewards recently posted jobs:

| Days Since Posted | Bonus |
|-------------------|-------|
| 0-7 days | 5 points |
| 8-30 days | 2.5 points |
| 30+ days | 0 points |

---

## Complete Example

### User Profile: **Sarah**

```json
{
  "name": "Sarah",
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Reactt", "TypeScript"],  // Note typo
  "preferredJobTypes": ["FULL_TIME"],
  "location": "Addis Ababa",
  "experience": "3 years as Frontend Developer"
}
```

### Job Posting: **Frontend Developer**

```json
{
  "title": "Frontend Developer",
  "skills": ["javascript", "React", "CSS"],  // Different casing
  "type": "FULL_TIME",
  "location": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",
  "requirements": ["2-4 years experience", "React expertise"],
  "postedAt": "2024-10-18" // 3 days ago
}
```

### Score Calculation

| Factor | Calculation | Points | Details |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Skills** | Sarah has 2/3 required skills | **26.7** | "JavaScript" ✅, "Reactt"→"React" ✅ (fuzzy), CSS ❌ |
| **Job Type** | FULL_TIME matches preference | **30.0** | Perfect match |
| **Location** | Addis Ababa matches | **15.0** | Substring match |
| **Experience** | 3 years perfect for 2-4 year requirement | **10.0** | Mid-level match |
| **Recency** | Posted 3 days ago | **5.0** | Fresh posting |
| **TOTAL** | | **🌟 86.7 / 100** | Excellent match! |

### What Sarah Sees

```

## Fuzzy Matching Algorithm

The system uses **Levenshtein Distance** to measure similarity between strings.

### What is Levenshtein Distance?

It counts the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to change one string into another.

### Examples

| String 1 | String 2 | Distance | Similarity | Match? |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| javascript | javascprit | 2 | 90% | ✅ Yes |
| React | Reactt | 1 | 83% | ✅ Yes |
| Python | Pythn | 1 | 83% | ✅ Yes |
| Java | Python | 5 | 17% | ❌ No |

**Threshold:** 80% similarity required for a match

### Formula

```
Similarity = 1 - (Levenshtein Distance / Max Length)
```

Example:
```
"javascprit" vs "javascript"
Distance: 2 (swap 'p' and 'r')
Max Length: 10
Similarity: 1 - (2/10) = 0.8 = 80% ✅
```

## Special Features

### 1. Excludes Already Applied Jobs
The system automatically filters out jobs the user has already applied to.

### 2. Top N Recommendations
Returns the top 6 highest-scoring jobs by default.

### 3. Match Reasons
Each recommended job includes reasons for the recommendation:
- "67% skills match"
- "Matches preferred job type"
- "Location match"
- "Experience level matches"
- "Recently posted"

### 4. Progressive Fallbacks
If user profile is incomplete, the system uses neutral scores to avoid penalizing users.

## FAQ

**Q: Why not use AI for recommendations?**  
A: Simple algorithms work great for 95% of cases. AI adds cost, complexity, and latency without much benefit for basic matching.

**Q: Can we add more skill aliases?**  
A: Yes! Edit the `SKILL_ALIASES` object in `/src/lib/recommendations.ts`

**Q: How do we adjust the weights?**  
A: Modify the scoring weights in the `scoreJobs()` function based on your data.

**Q: Does it learn from user behavior?**  
A: Not yet. This is a future enhancement.
